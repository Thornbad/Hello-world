# hello-world
I'm here to practice the coding i'm learning... i learn quickly, but have physical limitations!

I am currently following the guide Learn to code in 2020, at this link https://zerotomastery.io/blog/learn-to-code-in-2020-get-hired-and-have-fun-along-the-way/?fbclid=IwAR3_tVhKS6eBLe_6j2s9rIBV31sosQ_ZachAFfZ_pSQ7cHycn-39Wd_i4UI . I reached a point where i needed practical application to solidify what i learned, so i created a Github to see about working on projects to make me more efficient and helpful, using Visual Studio Code as my program editor, for the most part!
